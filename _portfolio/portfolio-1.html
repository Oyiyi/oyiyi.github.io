During the competitions, I was one of the Finalists and was ranked world-#1 in round 2.<br/><br/>

This competition launched the first AI track for the popular Meta Hacker Cup programming competition, designed to assess the capabilities of Generative AI in performing autonomous code generation tasks. It aims to test the limits of AI in complex coding challenges and measure the performance gap between AI systems and human programmers.<br/><br/> 

Featuring both "open evaluation, open model" and "open evaluation, closed model" tracks, this competition invites diverse participation from research institutions of varied interests and resource constraints, including academic labs, AI startups, large technology companies, and AI enthusiasts. The goal of the competition is to develop and democratize meaningful advancements in code automation with the very first open evaluation process for competitive AI programmers.<br/><br/>

The code generation and RAG pipeline I created and utilized in this competition have all Hacker Cup problems since 2011 alongside their respective solutions in a multimodal (image and text) format.<br/><br/>
