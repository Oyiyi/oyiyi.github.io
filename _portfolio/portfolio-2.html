The 2023 Edge Native AI Hackathon co-hosted by Linux Foundation Edge (LF Edge), European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and Open Compute Project Foundation (OCP), who collaborated and chose to issue a challenge in the problem area of AI Hardware Software Co-design.

Our team pitched our case for training an AI LLM with a user-friendly UI to provide geographically and contextual relevant information on demand. Demonstrated use cases include automatic translation in near real time, contextually relevant information like who was visiting their booth with interesting background information and more.
