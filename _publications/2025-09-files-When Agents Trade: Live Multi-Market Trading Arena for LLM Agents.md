excerpt: 'Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison under real conditions.'

Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in financial trading, it remains unclear whether they
can reason and adapt in live markets, as most studies test models
instead of agents, cover limited periods and assets, and rely on
unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce Agent Market
Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA
integrates verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse
agent architectures within a unified trading framework, enabling
fair and continuous comparison under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk styles,
and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4,
and Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency
and stock markets demonstrate that agent frameworks display
markedly distinct behavioral patterns, spanning from aggressive
risk-taking to conservative decision-making, whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus establishes
a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in
LLM-based agents.
