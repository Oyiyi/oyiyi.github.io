excerpt: 'We evaluated the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capabilities of vision–language models using Financial Critical Error Detection, a visual benchmark designed to assess how accurately these models read and interpret financial documents at the fact level. The benchmark includes 500 image & HTML document pairs with expert-annotated financial facts, covering more than 700 numerical and time-based data points (such as amounts, percentages, dates, and reporting periods).'
